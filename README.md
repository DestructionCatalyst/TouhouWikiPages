# Touhou Wiki Pages

This repository includes the pages from Touhou Wiki (<https://en.touhouwiki.net/>) that contain character dialogues. They had to be manually downloaded and saved here because the wiki has a protection from bots, so it's not possible to download them autamatically straight from the source. These files are used by my Touhou wiki parser that extracts the dialogues from them to create the dataset for my Touhou Dialogue Generator.

The pages uploaded here were downoaded on 11.07.2021. If some content on the wiki is updated, this will not affect this repository unless I manually update it.

THIS CODE DOESN'T BELONG TO ME, AND I AM NOT CLAIMING IT IN ANY WAY. It can be obtained by anybody using "Save as" option in your browser on the pages of the wiki.


## Contents of the repositry:

Each file has the name in the format TH(game_number * 10)_(file_number), where game_number is, e.g. 6 for EoSD, 12.5 for Double Spoiler, etc. File numbers are just numbers from 1 to n, where n is the total amount of files with dialogues in the given game.

### These games dialogue pages are present:

- All main story games, starting from Touhou 6, EXCEPT Touhou 12 main game sceinario, as its dialogue pages are formatted differently and need a different parser (the extras for this game have the right format and are present)
- Fighting games (7.5, 12.3, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5). Touhou 10.5 and everything except Sanae scenario in 12.3 is not present for the same reason as TH12 main game. I honestly regret adding these games because they have very many files with very few dialogue lines, so it's probably not worth downloading all of them.
- Spinoffs: 12.5, 12.8, 14.3, 16.5, 17.5. Touhou 9.5 is not included because of the absence of actual dialogue in in.

### These are not present:
- Everything stated as "not included" above
- PC98 games
- Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red (particualrly Aya's interviews with different characters)
